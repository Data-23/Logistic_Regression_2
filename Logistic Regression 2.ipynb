    "\n",
    "# **ROC Curve:**\n",

    "# #### Q1. What is the purpose of grid search cv in machine learning, and how does it work?\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Purpose:**\n",
    "# - Grid search CV (Cross-Validation) is used to find the optimal hyperparameters for a model.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **How it Works:**\n",
    "# - Defines a grid of hyperparameter values.\n",

    "# - Faster and less computationally intensive.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **When to Choose:**\n",
    "# - Use Grid Search for smaller hyperparameter spaces.\n",
    "# - Use Randomized Search for larger hyperparameter spaces or when computational resources are limited.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Q3. What is data leakage, and why is it a problem in machine learning? Provide an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Data Leakage:**\n",
    "# - Occurs when information from outside the training dataset is used to create the model, leading to over-optimistic performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Example:**\n",

    "# - Ensure no information from the test set is used in the training process.\n",
    "# - Perform all data preprocessing steps within cross-validation folds.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Q5. What is a confusion matrix, and what does it tell you about the performance of a classification model?\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Confusion Matrix:**\n",
    "# - A table showing the actual vs. predicted classifications.\n",
    "# - Provides counts of True Positives, True Negatives, False Positives, and False Negatives.\n",
    "# - Helps evaluate model performance beyond simple accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Q6. Explain the difference between precision and recall in the context of a confusion matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Precision:**\n",
    "# - Proportion of true positive predictions among all positive predictions.\n",
    "# - \\[\n",
    "#   \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}\n",
    "#   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Recall:**\n",
    "# - Proportion of true positives among all actual positives.\n",

    "\n",
    "# #### Q8. What are some common metrics that can be derived from a confusion matrix, and how are they calculated?\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Common Metrics:**\n",
    "# - **Accuracy:**\n",
    "#   \\[\n",
    "#   \\text{Accuracy} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{True Negatives}}{\\text{Total Predictions}}\n",
    "#   \\]\n",
    "# - **Precision:**\n",
    "#   \\[\n",
    "#   \\text{Precision} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Positives}}\n",
    "#   \\]\n",
    "# - **Recall:**\n",
    "#   \\[\n",
    "#   \\text{Recall} = \\frac{\\text{True Positives}}{\\text{True Positives} + \\text{False Negatives}}\n",
    "#   \\]\n",
    "# - **F1 Score:**\n",
    "#   \\[\n",

    "#   \\]\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Q9. What is the relationship between the accuracy of a model and the values in its confusion matrix?\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Relationship:**\n",
    "# - Accuracy is derived from the sum of True Positives and True Negatives divided by the total number of predictions.\n",
    "# - It provides an overall measure of correctness but can be misleading with imbalanced classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# #### Q10. How can you use a confusion matrix to identify potential biases or limitations in your machine learning model?\n",
    "\n",
    "# **Identifying Biases:**\n",
    "# - Check for imbalance in True Positives and True Negatives vs. False Positives and False Negatives.\n",
    "# - High False Negatives may indicate bias against the minority class.\n",
    "# - Analyze the distribution of errors to identify systematic biases.\n",
    "\n",
